# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the failing tests in the QA ChatCanvas Backend application, specifically focusing on the integration with the Vercel AI SDK. The main issue is that the `convertToCoreMessages` function from the 'ai' package is not being recognized, causing multiple test failures. This feature will update the message transformation pipeline to be compatible with the current version of the Vercel AI SDK.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fix the failing tests related to the AI SDK integration, so that the test suite passes successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the test suite THEN all tests related to message transformation should pass
2. WHEN using the `transformMessagesForAI` function THEN it should correctly convert UI messages to model messages
3. WHEN the application interacts with the AI SDK THEN it should use the correct API methods from the current SDK version

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure the message transformation pipeline is compatible with Vercel AI SDK v5, so that the application can properly communicate with AI models.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing functions from the 'ai' package THEN the correct function names from the current SDK version should be used
2. WHEN transforming messages THEN the format should be compatible with the AI models used in the application
3. WHEN system messages are added to the conversation THEN they should be properly formatted according to the SDK requirements

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure that all API endpoints using the message transformation pipeline work correctly, so that users can interact with the QA assistant without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the update-canvas API endpoint is called THEN it should successfully transform messages and communicate with the AI model
2. WHEN the API receives user messages THEN it should correctly process them using the updated transformation pipeline
3. WHEN errors occur during message transformation THEN they should be properly handled and reported

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure backward compatibility with existing code that uses the message transformation pipeline, so that no additional changes are required in other parts of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing code calls the message transformation functions THEN it should continue to work without requiring changes to the function signatures
2. WHEN the application is deployed THEN it should work with the same behavior as before, but without errors
3. IF the AI SDK has breaking changes THEN appropriate adapter functions should be created to maintain the existing API
