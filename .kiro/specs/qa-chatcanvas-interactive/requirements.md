# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building the backend API that powers the ChatCanvas interactive QA analysis system. The backend will serve as the AI-powered engine that processes Jira ticket data and provides conversational capabilities for generating, refining, and perfecting acceptance criteria and test cases. This API will be consumed by a Chrome extension frontend and must provide robust, streaming-capable endpoints for real-time collaboration between QA analysts and AI.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Initial Ticket Analysis API

**User Story:** As a Chrome extension frontend, I want to send Jira ticket data to the backend for AI analysis, so that I can receive structured QA documentation to display in the ChatCanvas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend receives a POST request to /api/analyze-ticket THEN it SHALL validate the ticket data and QA settings payload
2. WHEN processing the analysis request THEN the backend SHALL use Vercel AI SDK's generateObject to create structured QA documentation
3. WHEN generating the analysis THEN the backend SHALL return a complete QACanvasDocument JSON object that includes ticket explanation, acceptance criteria, and test cases
4. WHEN the ticket data is invalid or incomplete THEN the backend SHALL return appropriate error responses with clear error messages
5. WHEN AI processing fails THEN the backend SHALL handle errors gracefully and return structured error responses

### Requirement 2: Structured Document Generation Logic

**User Story:** As a backend API, I want to generate comprehensive QA documentation following intelligent structure rules, so that the frontend receives consistent, high-quality analysis results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating QA documentation THEN the backend SHALL follow the intelligent structure: simplified ticket explanation, configuration warnings (if needed), acceptance criteria, and test cases
2. WHEN creating test cases THEN the backend SHALL format them according to the testCaseFormat specified in QA settings (Gherkin, steps, or table format)
3. WHEN the backend detects configuration conflicts THEN it SHALL include warning blocks in the generated document (e.g., API testing disabled but ticket requires API tests)
4. WHEN processing ticket data THEN the backend SHALL extract and simplify technical jargon into clear, understandable explanations
5. WHEN generating content THEN the backend SHALL ensure all sections are properly structured and complete before returning the response

### Requirement 3: Conversational Refinement API

**User Story:** As a Chrome extension frontend, I want to send chat messages to refine QA documentation, so that users can iteratively improve content through natural conversation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend receives a POST request to /api/update-canvas THEN it SHALL process the chat message history using Vercel AI SDK's streamText
2. WHEN processing refinement requests THEN the backend SHALL regenerate the complete document incorporating the requested changes rather than applying patches
3. WHEN streaming responses THEN the backend SHALL use Server-Sent Events (SSE) format compatible with useChat hook
4. WHEN the current document context is provided THEN the backend SHALL include it in the system prompt for coherent modifications
5. WHEN streaming updates THEN the backend SHALL format responses as UIMessageStreamParts for real-time frontend consumption

### Requirement 4: Structured Suggestion Generation API

**User Story:** As a Chrome extension frontend, I want to request contextual suggestions from the backend, so that I can display actionable recommendations to improve test documentation coverage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend receives a POST request to /api/generate-suggestions THEN it SHALL use AI tools to generate structured suggestion objects
2. WHEN generating suggestions THEN the backend SHALL use the qaSuggestionTool to ensure structured output with suggestionType, description, and targetSection fields
3. WHEN processing suggestion requests THEN the backend SHALL analyze the current document context to provide relevant recommendations
4. WHEN returning suggestions THEN the backend SHALL categorize them by type (edge_case, ui_verification, functional_test, clarification_question)
5. WHEN the document context is provided THEN the backend SHALL generate suggestions that are specific and actionable for that content

### Requirement 5: Chat History Management

**User Story:** As a backend API, I want to properly handle chat message history and context, so that conversational interactions maintain coherence and context across multiple requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving chat messages THEN the backend SHALL process the complete UIMessage history to maintain conversation context
2. WHEN converting messages for AI processing THEN the backend SHALL use convertToModelMessages to transform UIMessage to ModelMessage format
3. WHEN maintaining conversation state THEN the backend SHALL rely on the frontend's useChat hook for message persistence
4. WHEN processing follow-up messages THEN the backend SHALL include previous conversation context in AI prompts
5. WHEN handling message conversion errors THEN the backend SHALL return appropriate error responses with clear debugging information

### Requirement 6: Data Schema Validation and Type Safety

**User Story:** As a backend API, I want to enforce strict data schemas and type safety, so that all API interactions are predictable and reliable for the frontend consumers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving API requests THEN the backend SHALL validate all input payloads using Zod schemas (ticketAnalysisPayloadSchema, etc.)
2. WHEN generating responses THEN the backend SHALL ensure all output conforms to defined schemas (QACanvasDocumentSchema, QASuggestionSchema)
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the backend SHALL return structured error responses with specific field-level error details
4. WHEN processing QA settings THEN the backend SHALL validate qaCategories and testCaseFormat configurations
5. WHEN schema evolution occurs THEN the backend SHALL maintain backward compatibility and provide clear migration paths

### Requirement 7: QA Settings Processing and Validation

**User Story:** As a backend API, I want to process and validate QA configuration settings, so that AI-generated content aligns with user preferences and organizational standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving QA settings THEN the backend SHALL validate qaCategories configuration (functional, UI/UX, API, security, performance, etc.)
2. WHEN processing testCaseFormat preferences THEN the backend SHALL support Gherkin, steps, and table formats in generated content
3. WHEN analyzing tickets THEN the backend SHALL incorporate active QA categories into the analysis and content generation
4. WHEN detecting configuration conflicts THEN the backend SHALL include appropriate warnings in the generated QACanvasDocument
5. WHEN invalid QA settings are provided THEN the backend SHALL return validation errors with specific guidance for correction

### Requirement 8: Error Handling and AI Uncertainty Management

**User Story:** As a backend API, I want to handle AI processing errors and uncertainties gracefully, so that the frontend receives meaningful responses even when the AI encounters unclear or ambiguous requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI doesn't understand a user request THEN the backend SHALL implement a "try, verify, and ask for feedback" approach in the response
2. WHEN the AI makes assumptions THEN the backend SHALL include assumption explanations in the streamed response for user confirmation
3. WHEN generating content based on assumptions THEN the backend SHALL provide complete document updates that users can accept or request modifications for
4. WHEN API errors occur THEN the backend SHALL return structured error responses with clear error codes, messages, and recovery suggestions
5. WHEN the AI encounters ambiguous requirements THEN the backend SHALL generate clarifying questions as part of the conversational response rather than failing silently
