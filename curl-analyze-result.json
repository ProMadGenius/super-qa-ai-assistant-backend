  "ticketSummary": {
    "problem": "ACH payment files were imported twice, causing duplicate cash-on-account entries with no check details on closed invoices. Users cannot reverse or correct those payments because there is no way to reference the transaction.",
    "solution": "Ensure that ACH payments always record and display check details when applied. Enable reversal of payments even if originally missing details. Prevent reprocessing of the same EDI file. Provide a data‐correction script to remove the erroneous cash receipt entries, reopen invoices, and allow proper reapplication.",
    "context": "This involves the Accounts Receivable component of the Financials suite, specifically the import and application of bank (BofA) EDI files via AMTSRVPROC, the display of check details on invoices, and the reversal and data‐correction workflows for cash receipts."
