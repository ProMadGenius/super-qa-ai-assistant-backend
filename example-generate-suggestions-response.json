  "contextSummary": "Generated suggestions for a diagnostic logging implementation focused on Factory Ticket flag changes. The current document has 2 acceptance criteria and 2 test cases primarily covering functional and database testing. Suggestions emphasize edge cases, negative testing, and UI considerations to improve diagnostic effectiveness."
