Correct dates are 2/23, 2/26, 2/27, 2/28 and 2/29. You only have 4 days listed in your scripts. Should we delete the cashdetail records PRIOR to deleting the cashreceipts records, so that the detail records do not get orphaned? We are removing ALL cash receipts done for those days… did the customer enter any MANUAL cash receipts for those days? I can find out from the customer. Customer wants the duplicate cash receipts removed from their system, and would like the INVOICES to be changed to OPEN, so that cash can be applied properly. I didn’t see scripts for this. This will need to be reworked again prior to correcting the data on the customers' test system. @Tina Lampus @Gary Poindexter",

I am unable to reverse these payments and correct them because I have no way to pull up the transaction as I have nothing to reference. There are multiple payments like this from multiple days.Open one of the referenced payments. No check data is attached the invoice yet the invoice is closed. Multiple invoices and payments credit to the accts.",
